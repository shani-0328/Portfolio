HOW TO ADD YOUR PROFILE PHOTO:

1. Prepare your photo:
   - Square format is recommended (e.g., 400x400 pixels or larger)
   - Professional headshot or clear photo of your face
   - JPG or PNG format works best

2. Replace the file:
   - Save your photo as "profile.jpg" 
   - Place it in this directory (frontend/public/images/)
   - This will replace the placeholder image

3. Refresh your development server:
   - Your new photo will appear in the hero section of the portfolio

Note: If you prefer using a different filename, you'll need to update:
- The HeroRetroModernEnhanced.tsx component
- The PortfolioSeeder.php file in your Laravel backend
